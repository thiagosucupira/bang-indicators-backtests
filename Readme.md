# Trading Strategies: Fair Value Gap (FVG) and Williams %R

Hey there! Let's dive into two exciting trading strategies: Fair Value Gap (FVG) and Williams %R.

## Fair Value Gap (FVG) Strategy

This strategy is all about finding and capitalizing on price gaps in the market:

- It identifies gaps that form when the market moves quickly, leaving "fair value gaps"
- When price returns to the middle of a gap, it's considered a potential trade opportunity
- For bullish gaps, we go long; for bearish gaps, we go short

Risk Management:
- Stop Loss: Set at the edge of the gap. If the price moves beyond this point, the gap is considered "filled," and our trade idea is invalidated.
- Take Profit: Placed at twice the distance of the stop loss. This 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio aims to ensure our winners outweigh our losers.

## Williams %R Strategy

This strategy uses the Williams %R indicator to spot potential market reversals:

- We buy when Williams %R crosses above -80, suggesting the market might be oversold
- We sell when Williams %R crosses below -20, indicating the market might be overbought

Risk Management:
- Stop Loss: Set at one day's price range from the entry price. This adapts to the day's volatility, providing a simple yet responsive risk measure.
- Take Profit: Placed at twice the distance of the stop loss, maintaining our 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio.

Why these levels? The -80 and -20 thresholds are standard for Williams %R, historically good at identifying potential reversals without being too sensitive to minor fluctuations.

## The Power of 2:1 Risk-Reward

Both strategies use a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio. Here's why:
- It allows us to be profitable even if we're right less than half the time
- For example, with this ratio, we can make money even with a 40% win rate
- It helps manage emotions by setting clear exit points before entering a trade

## What These Strategies Offer

- Visualization: Get clear, colorful charts showing price action, indicators, and trade signals

Remember, while these strategies are fascinating to explore, always approach real trading with caution. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and all trading carries risk.
